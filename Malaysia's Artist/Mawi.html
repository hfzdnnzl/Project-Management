Initially, he was eliminated from the prelud concert but re-absorbed at the end of the first week of concerts based on a jury selection of 8 the dismissed student. Mawi began her studies at the Academy of Fantasia with Marsha in the second week. Mawi has won numerous victories over all the contests he has won until he was named King of SMS for frequently winning awards via SMS vote before controversy arose against him from the media.

                            For three months during the competition, he continued to become a national icon on par with famous country singers like Siti Nurhaliza. Asmawi won the Fantasia Academy 3 with an easy and predictable victory, unlike previous Fantasia Academy champions. As a result of his victory, a Mawi phenomenon has emerged in Malaysia.</p>
