                    <p>Yunalis binti Mat Zara'ai (born 14 November 1986), known professionally as Yuna, is a Malaysian singer-songwriter. Yuna's initial exposure came through the viral success of her music uploaded to Myspace, which received over one million plays. This online success alerted the Indie-Pop label/management company to her music, and in early 2011 she signed with the Fader Label. She is best known for the collaboration with Usher on her breakout single, "Crush", which peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard Adult R&B chart. </p>
