                    <p>Payung Teduh is an alternative Indonesian band with the fusion of folk, keroncong and jazz. Umbrella Teduh was formed in late 2007 with the initial formation of Is (vocalist) and Comi (counter bass). In 2008, Payung Teduh invited Cito to join together as a drummer and then invited Ivan as a guitar player and trumpet player in 2010. The Wind of the Rain was the first song to bring out their own colors. Over time, other songs, such as Kucari Kamu, Amy, for Women Who Are in the Arms, also include works from theater performances with Chess Ari Wibowo such as Restless, Stories about Mountains and Seas, and Amalia Puri's work titled Sleep and night. In the end Payung Teduh decided to make his first indie album which was released at the end of 2010. At the end of 2017 Mohammad Istiqamah Djamad decided to leave Payung Teduh because he felt he was no longer in line with the band.</p>
