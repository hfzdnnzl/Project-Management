            Oh-oh-oh-mm-mm<br/>
            Yeah, yeah<br/>
            Yeah, yeah<br/>
            You know I’m your type, right? (Right)<br/>
            Mark your calendar, tonight’s gonna be your life’s highlight (Light)<br/>
            Boy, we gon' roll up, we gon' roll out, look<br/>
            This is the land of fast, bet you ain’t used to that, nah<br/>
            First to one-up your last, she can stay in your past<br/>
            Honey, I don’t stop for no one but I’d pause for you, you, you, you<br/>
            So let’s go downtown and get real high<br/>
            It’d be psycho to psychoanalyze<br/>
            Leave all of your inhibitions behind<br/>
            Tonight let’s test all the borderlines like<br/>
            How far out does the indigo go?<br/>
            Boy, let’s find out, take the longer way home<br/>
            Have my body all superimposed<br/>
            Right on top of yours, oh<br/>
            As far as the indica goes<br/>
            I’m hating that you’re still in your clothes<br/>
            Babe, touch me slow all adagio<br/>
            Like oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah<br/>
            Know you like a little attitude (Attitude, attitude)<br/>
            A little spunk, a little gumption<br/>
            Well baby, have a lot of gratitude<br/>
            'Cause I can be sweet, or poised, or a little too feisty to function, yeah<br/>
            So shut up and just hop in, we gon' ride in style<br/>
            If thrill was a sport, I’d be the poster child<br/>
            I listen to none, but I’m all ears for you, you, you, yeah<br/>
            So let’s drive by the city skyline<br/>
            I’m so over this overthinkin' mind<br/>
            Leave all of your inhibitions behind<br/>
            Tonight let’s test all the borderlines like<br/>
            How far out does the indigo go?<br/>
            Boy, let’s find out, take the longer way home<br/>
            Have my body all superimposed<br/>
            Right on top of yours, oh<br/>
            As far as the indica goes<br/>
            I’m hating that you’re still in your clothes<br/>
            Babe, touch me slow all adagio<br/>
            Like oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah<br/>
            Baby go slow, slow, slow, slow (Slow)<br/>
            Under the indigo, go (Indigo)<br/>
            Steady and slow, slow, slow, slow (Yeah)<br/>
            Under the indigo, indigo<br/>
