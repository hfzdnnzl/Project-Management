                            Days passed by and now we playin' by our own rules<br/>
                            Chase Hennessy with a kiss and then some great view<br/>
                            Dancin' in the parkin' lot, jammin' to some old school<br/>
                            We the kings of the city<br/>
                            All the lights look pretty<br/>

                            We in the club like 50<br/>
                            Ayy, kick my feet up on the dash<br/>

                            And we just all in the moment<br/>
                            'Cause it's a hunnid degrees<br/>

                            Playin' 'round, all you hear is bed sounds<br/>
                            Turnin' up the music when we get a lil' too loud<br/>
                            Turn around and smile, oh, she got the pearly whites<br/>
                            Oh, she 'bout to suck me dry, I need me some Pedialyte<br/>
                            We gon' take it slow, hit it while she on the phone<br/>
                            Said she want some more, keep it on the low-low<br/>
                            Ayy, kick my feet up on the dash<br/>
