                            Speak of the devil, my, oh my<br/>
                            Walk in with that devilish smile<br/>
                            That's one thing I haven't seen in a while<br/>
                            (In a while)<br/>
                            How have you been since I called you mine?<br/>
                            You look so good in this light<br/>
                            Got me reminiscin' 'bout our good times<br/>
                            (Good ol' times)<br/>
                            And I know, I know, I know<br/>
                            We've been better off alone<br/>
                            But we laugh about old pictures on your phone and I forget<br/>
                            And you make, you make, you make<br/>
                            It easy like a zephyr<br/>
                            You're still just the way I remember<br/>
                            Tonight I just wanna hit reverse<br/>
                            Been a year since we finished<br/>
                            Baby, me and you, we vintage<br/>
                            But tonight you make me miss it<br/>
                            And I just wanna dance with you like<br/>
                            It's summer 1976<br/>
                            Raise my heart rate like it's interest<br/>
                            Jog my memory on your kisses<br/>
                            For old times sake, you got me singin'<br/>
                            Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah<br/>
                            Got me singin'<br/>
                            Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah<br/>
                            Got me dreamin'<br/>
                            Still as charismatic as ever<br/>
                            Comebacks come back clean and clever<br/>
                            Why we ended, I don't remember<br/>
                            Can't believe I once said "See U Never"<br/>
                            Wait a minute, my head's a mess<br/>
                            Please don't tell me you like my dress<br/>
                            Why am I wishin' we were wearing less?<br/>
                            Won't be long before "no" becomes "yes"<br/>
                            And you know, you know, you know<br/>
                            All the ways to get to me<br/>
                            As if there were an easy recipe<br/>
                            A bit of hard-to-get, a dash of sweet<br/>
                            So I say, I say, we pay<br/>
                            Tribute to our history<br/>
                            Only reenactin', no repeats<br/>
                            Here we go again<br/>
                            I'ma handle you with care like you're antique<br/>
                            Been a year since we finished<br/>
