I thought we were friends</br>
But now I see the end</br>
You got caught just trying to be someone you're not</br>
Pretending that you care but you care for my connections</br>
Making new acquaintances, friends in higher places</br>
But you should ask yourself, yeah</br>
Who are you without me?</br>
You're just a blank marquee</br>
Tryna cop my steez</br>
Get your own POV</br>
Your toxicity (your toxicity)</br>
Won't get the best of me</br>
Look into the mirror, try and see it clearer</br>
You should be reflected on all of your decisions</br>
You're the type of person to use up my affection, yeah</br>
You should ask yourself</br>
Who are you without me?</br>
You're just a blank marquee</br>
Tryna cop my steez</br>

Get your own POV</br>
Hold on, hold up, lemme tell my side</br>
Who am I without you?</br>
I said I'm the same-ass dude (I'm the same guy)</br>
You wanna call me brand new</br>
Like it's all my fault, but that's what you won't do (that's what you won't do)</br>
Nah, now don't try start me</br>
Think I'm your John to your Paul McCartney (yeah)</br>
Call me a wall, nothing on the marquee</br>
But we both co-headline the party</br>
Yeah, you were right beside me</br>
Next day try to criticize me (come on)</br>
Used to love me now you despise me</br>
But at this point nothing could surprise me, I know</br>
Who are you without me? (Yeah)</br>
You're just a blank marquee</br>
Tryna cop my steez (G)</br>

You should check yourself (ooh, ooh)</br>
You might lose what you have (ah)</br>
Life ain't about the ladder, baby</br>
Who are you without me? (Who are you without me?)</br>
You're just a blank marquee (you're just a blank marquee)</br>
