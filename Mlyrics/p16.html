                            Don't want much, I just want everything <br/>
                            Thought that I could, do almost anything<br/>
                            One step in front of the other<br/>
                            Thought that I could do it alone<br/>
                            In the blink of an eye, it's just another day<br/>
                            Telling me why, I'll find another way<br/>
                            Got this feeling, got me reeling<br/>
                            I can almost start believing<br/>
                            Now there's me and you<br/>
                            And we are not alone<br/>
                            You and me<br/>
                            We are together now<br/>
                            Through my window, I can see there's<br/>
                            More than you and more than me<br/>
                            Me and you<br/>
                            And we are not alone<br/>
                            Different view<br/>
                            We are together now<br/>
                            Through my window, I can see<br/>
                            Our wildest dreams could be so real<br/>
                            I see a spark, it starts a fire<br/>
                            blogspot.comIs this the one worth waiting for?<br/>
                            Thought that I could do it without you<br/>
                            Can't exist like this anymore<br/>
                            Now there's me and you<br/>
                            And we are not alone<br/>
                            You and me<br/>
                            We are together now<br/>
                            Through my window, I can see there's<br/>
                            More than you and more than me<br/>
                            Now there's me and you, you and me<br/>
                            We are not alone and we are together<br/>
                            Through my window I can see<br/>
                            Our wildest dreams could be so real<br/><br/>
