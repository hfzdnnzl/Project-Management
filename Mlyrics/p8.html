                    <p>
                            You call me on a lazy afternoon<br/>
            Asking me what I'm up to<br/>
            Let's find something to do<br/>
            Baby I'd be down, down, down<br/>
            Down, down, down, down, down, down<br/>
            You know I'd be down, down, down<br/>
            Down, down, down, down, down, down<br/>
            I see you arriving in your car, yeah<br/>
            Jet black Mercedes, built in the seventies<br/>
            Classic like you and me<br/>
            I'll be coming down, down, down<br/>
            Down, down, down, down, down, down<br/>
            I'll be coming down, down, down<br/>
            Down, down, down, down, down, down<br/>
            I feel a little rush<br/>
            I think I've got a little crush on you<br/>
            I hope it's not too much<br/>
            But babe when I'm with you, I hear it<br/>
            My heart singing<br/>
            La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la<br/>
            La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la<br/>
            Honestly I shouldn't waste time no more, eh yeah<br/>
            'Cause all these little boys you're chasing, did they break your heart?<br/>
            I know you've been down, down, down<br/>
            Down, down, down, down, down, down<br/>
            I won't let you down, down, down<br/>
            Down, down, down, down, down, down<br/>
            I feel a little rush<br/>
            I think I've got a little crush on you<br/>
            I hope it's not too much<br/>
            But girl when I'm with you, I hear it<br/>
            My heart singing<br/>
            La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la<br/>
            La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la, hey<br/>
            I see you the same<br/>
            I see it in the way that you behave around me<br/>
            And I can't tell<br/>
            What we have is different from anyone else<br/>
            'Cause you stop doing what you're doing<br/>
            When I call you come to me running<br/>
            And I would do the same for you<br/>
            So tell me that you feel it too, woah<br/>
            I feel a little rush<br/>
            I think I've got a little crush on you (little crush on you)<br/>
            I hope it's not too much, oh ho<br/>
            But babe when I'm with you, I hear it<br/>
            My heart singing<br/>
            La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la (ooh yeah baby, my heart singing)<br/>
            La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la, oh<br/>
            I think I've got a crush, babe<br/>
            Crush on you too<br/>
            Feel a little rush, baby<br/>
            And I feel it too<br/>
            I think I've got a crush, babe<br/>
            Crush on you too<br/>
            Feel a little rush, baby<br/>
