            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Can't stop thinkin' about it<br/>
            And your changes won't stop<br/>
            Once she used to be cool now she's not<br/>

            A' a' a' aa<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Everyday like the same thing<br/>
            But everyday everything is changing<br/>
            Got some more buddies and I made a couple new ones<br/>
            Gotta like smarter coz other people was too dumb<br/>
            When a little money coming in everybody buggin' out<br/>
            When the money don't come they still buggin' out<br/>
            I'm fit right in but I feel left out<br/>
            And all I gotta say is<br/>
            When I look around all I see<br/>
            Not what it used to be<br/>
            Everyday change around me<br/>
            And the changes won't stop<br/>
            She used to be cool now she's not<br/>
            I'm telling myself can't be well like<br/>
            Na na na na na<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Can't stop thinkin' about it<br/>
            And the changes won't stop<br/>
            She used to be cool now she's not<br/>
            I'm telling myself can't be well like<br/>
            A' A' A' aa<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            We used to call each other baby<br/>
            We used to texting call each other on the daily<br/>
            I can't believe I used to think we were so mix<br/>
            The way you went around would do like it was OK<br/>
            But that was in the past now I'm livin' in the future<br/>
            Your new man is Haha my new girl is Cuter<br/>
            I'm wayy past the BS I went through went recessing<br/>
            Now I got my ex singing<br/>
            When I look around all I see<br/>
            Not what it used to be<br/>
            Everyday change around me<br/>
            And the changes won't stop<br/>
            She used to be cool now she's not<br/>

            I though I had it all figured out but<br/>
            The only way to know is to keep your mouth shut<br/>
            Livin' in a dream wakeup to a nightmare<br/>
            I realize all along that I was right here<br/>
            And the changes won't stop<br/>
            I used to be cool and now I'm hot<br/>
            Keep tellin' myself I'm pullin' myself<br/>

            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Just ain't the same no more<br/>
            Can't stop thinkin' about it<br/>
            And the changes won't stop<br/>
            Once she used to be cool now she's not<br/>
