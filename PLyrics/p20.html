                            Somebody told me you were leavin'<br/>
                            I didn't know<br/>
                            Somebody told me you're unhappy<br/>
                            But it doesn't show<br/>
                            Somebody told me that you don't want me no more<br/>
                            So you're walkin' out the door<br/>
                            Nobody told me you've been cryin'<br/>
                            Every night<br/>
                            Nobody told me you'd been dyin'<br/>
                            But didn't want to fight<br/>
                            Nobody told me that you fell out of love from me<br/>
                            So I'm settin' you free<br/>
                            Let me be the one to break it up<br/>
                            So you won't have to make excuses<br/>
                            We don't need to find a set up where<br/>
                            Someone wins and someone loses<br/>
                            We just have to say our love was true<br/>
                            But has now become a lie<br/>
                            So I'm tellin' you I love you one last time<br/>
                            And goodbye<br/>
                            Somebody told me you still loved me<br/>
                            Don't know why<br/>
                            Nobody told me that you only<br/>
                            Needed time to fly<br/>
                            Somebody told me that you want to come back when<br/>
                            Our love is real again<br/>
                            Let me be the one to break it up<br/>
                            So you won't have to make excuses<br/>

                            And goodbye<br/>
                            Just turn around and walk away<br/>
                            You don't have to live like this<br/>
                            But if you love me still then stay<br/>
                            Don't keep me waiting for that final kiss<br/>
                            We can work together through this test<br/>
                            Or we can work through it apart<br/>
                            I just need to get this off my chest<br/>
                            That you will always have my heart<br/>
                            Let me be the one to break it up<br/>
