                            Take me as you are </br>
                            Push me off the road</br>
                            the sadness,</br>
                            I need this time to be with you</br>
                            I'm freezing in the sun</br>
                            I'm burning in the rain</br>
                            The silence</br>
                            I'm screaming,</br>
                            Calling out your name</br>
                            And i do reside in your light</br>
                            that put up the fire with me and find</br>
                            Yeah you'll lose the side of your circles</br>
                            That's what i'll do if we say goodbye</br>
                            To be is all i gotta be</br>
                            And all that i see</br>
                            And all that i need this time</br>
                            To me the life you gave me</br>
                            The day you said goodnight.</br>
                            The calmness in your face</br>
                            That I see through the night</br>
                            The warm of your light is pressing on to us</br>
                            You didn't ask me why</br>
                            I never would have known</br>
                            oblivion is falling down</br>
                            And i do reside in your light</br>
                            Put out the fire with me and find</br>
                            Yeah you'll lose the side of your circles</br>
