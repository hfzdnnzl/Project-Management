                            So many faces, so many races <br/>
                            Different voices, different choices <br/>
                            Some are mad, while others laugh <br/>
                            Some live alone with no better half <br/>
                Others grieve while others curse <br/>
                And others mourn behind a big black hearse <br/>
                Some are pure and some half-bred <br/>
                Some are sober and some are wasted <br/>
                Some are rich because of fate and <br/>
                Some are poor with no food on their plate <br/>
                Some stand out while others blend <br/>
                Some are fat and stout while some are thin <br/>
                Some are friends and some are foes <br/>
                Some have some while some have most <br/>
                Every color and every hue <br/>
                Is represented by me and you <br/>
                Take a slide in the slope <br/>
                Take a look in the kaleidoscope <br/>
                Spinnin' round, make it twirl <br/>
                In this kaleidoscope world <br/>
                Some are great and some are few <br/>
                Others lie while some tell the truth <br/>
                Some say poems and some do sing <br/>
                Others sing through their guitar strings <br/>
                Some know it all while some act dumb <br/>
                Let the bassline strum to the bang of the drum <br/>
                Some can swim while some will sink <br/>
                And some will find their minds and think <br/>
                Others walk while others run <br/>
                You can't talk peace and have a gun <br/>
                Some are hurt and start to cry <br/>
                Don't ask me how don't ask me why <br/>
                Some are friends and some are foes<br/>
                Some have some while some have most <br/>
                Every color and every hue <br/>
                Is represented by me and you <br/>
                Take a slide in the slope <br/>
                Take a look in the kaleidoscope <br/>
